1) In this folder, there are several STL(.stl) files that are originated from the 'Grand Challenge Competition to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads' (https://simtk.org/projects/kneeloads). 
 These files are protected by the copyright from Stanford University (Copyright_Stanford University.PDF) that you can find in this folder as well.
Some of these files may be modified by AnyBody Technology A/S in order to increase the quality of these files.
If you want to publish any academic results, then please cite the following paper:
Fregly, B.J., Besier, T.F., Lloyd, D.G., Delp, S.L., Banks, S.A., Pandy, M.G., and D'Lima, D.D. Grand challenge competition to predict in vivo knee loads. Journal of Orthopaedic Research 30(4):503-513 (2012)

2) All the other format files are generated and managed by AnyBody Technology A/S.
Note that there may be several corresponding ANYSURF(.anysurf3) files that have as same names as those STL files mentioned above, and these ANYSURF files are generated by AnyBody Modeling System by converting those STL files in order to provide more suitable file formats for AnyBody Modeling System.
